# Spam-mail
Spam mail classification project using support vector machines (SVMs)
Spam mail classification project using support vector machines (SVMs) would involve training a model to distinguish between spam and non-spam (ham) sms's based on the content of the sms's.
The model would use the text of the sms as input, and would be trained on a dataset of labeled sms's. Once the model is trained, it can be used to classify new incoming sms's as spam or non-spam.
